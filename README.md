# NewsApp

This project was undertaken as a part of Android Basics:Networking course on Udacity.

The apps queries the The Guardian servers with a search string and fetches a JSON response.

This JSON response is parsed and the Headline, TrailText, DatePublished, Contributor and Thumbnail are extracted to be displayed on a recyclerview.

This app uses the Coordinator Layout whereas its children are AppBarLayout, FloatingActionButton and RecyclerView.

The app doesnâ€™t crash and works as expected, so no rough edges have been left out even in this bare bones version.
